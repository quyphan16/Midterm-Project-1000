# Favorite Destinations
### New York City
New York City is one of the top three destinations that I have been to so far. I have visted this destination twice during last summer and the previous summer before it.
I liked how the city almost seemed alive as there was always something going on in every block you turn too, and how there are numerous amounts of activites to do in the city.

### Vietnam
Vietnam is a special destination for me as my parents originally immigranted from Vietnam so I was always exposed to Vietnamese-American culture as a child.
It was really cool to see the difference in cultures from what we have here in America compared to daily life in Vietnam. I am revisting later this year and am excited to see what next trip brings.

### Boston
Boston is also close to home for me, as I was born in Boston, MA, and a lot of my family still resides in Boston. Because of this I have found myself revisiting often to see family.
As a city itself, I have always enjoyed Boston from the food to being able to see my family.
