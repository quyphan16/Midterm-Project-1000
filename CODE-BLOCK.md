# My Code Block
### Coding Project of this Semester:
I went into my INFOTC classes this year without any practices or experiences in coding at all.  So I had no expectations of what I was going to experience in
these classes.  I am still new to coding so far, but I have gather what I would consider basic knowledge in Python.

My favorite coding project/assignment that I have completed so far this semester is the Interstate Highway Project. The basic objective of the assignment is to
Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. If auxiliary, indicate what primary highway it serves. 
Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west.
